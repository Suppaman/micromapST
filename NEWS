micromapST - Version 1.0.0 Original Release

micromapST - Version 1.0.1 - Updates

1) Horizontal Stacked Bar glyph's (segbar, normbar, and ctrbar) (segments)
should support a minimum of 2 segments.  Code requires a minimum of 3 segments.
Fixed code to allow a minimum of 2 segments.

micromapST - Version 1.0.2 - Updates

The following updates were made to the micromapST packages for release 1.0.2, January 10, 2014.

Enhancements:
1) Added variable bar heights to the horizontal stacked bar glyphs (segbar, normbar, and ctrbar). 

2) Added dot at the mid-point of the horizontal stacked bar glyphs (segbar, mormbar)  Not needed
on the centered horizontal stacked bars, since they are already lined up on the median value.

4) Added the ability to provide the name of a column in the stateFrame as well the column number.

5) Added the ability to provide the name of a column in the sortVar call argument.

Fixes:
a) Renamed the details variables to better relate to the attribute they are controlling 
and the glyph type.

b) Fixed the logic used by the sortVar call argument to support the specification of multiple 
columns for the sorting order.  The original code worked when 1 column was specified, but did not
properly handle multiple columns.  Problem identified and fixed.
